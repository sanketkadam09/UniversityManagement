## 🔧 DEBUGGING BUTTONS NOT WORKING

### Step 1: Check Browser Console
```
1. Press F12 to open Developer Tools
2. Go to Console tab
3. Look for red error messages
4. Common errors:
   - "Cannot read property 'setXxx'"
   - "API call failed"
   - "CORS error"
```

### Step 2: Check Network Tab
```
1. F12 → Network tab
2. Click a button
3. Look for API requests
4. Check response status:
   - 200 = Success ✓
   - 400/401/403 = Auth/validation error
   - 500 = Server error
```

### Step 3: Check React DevTools
```
1. Install React DevTools browser extension
2. F12 → Components tab
3. Find component
4. Check props and state
5. Verify state changes when you interact
```

### Step 4: Check Backend Logs
```
Terminal with backend running:
- Look for error messages ❌
- Check API response ✅
- Verify MongoDB query worked
```

## 🐛 COMMON ISSUES & FIXES

### Issue: "Login button doesn't work"
```
Solution:
1. Check backend is running
   → Terminal: npm run dev in /backend
2. Check MONGODB_URI in .env
   → Should be your MongoDB Atlas connection
3. Check test user exists
   → Run: npm run seed in /backend
4. Check browser console for errors
   → F12 → Console tab
```

### Issue: "Can't add college/course/etc"
```
Solution:
1. Check all form fields are filled
   → Hover over input field for validation message
2. Check state management
   → Use React DevTools to verify state
3. Check browser console for errors
   → F12 → Console tab
4. Verify function is properly bound
   → Check onClick={handleAddXxx} is correct
```

### Issue: "Buttons appear but don't respond"
```
Solution:
1. Check disabled attribute
   → Button may be disabled due to validation
2. Check onClick handler
   → Inspect element with F12
   → Verify onClick has correct handler
3. Check React rendering
   → Component may not be re-rendering
   → Check state isn't blocked
```

### Issue: "File upload button doesn't work"
```
Solution:
1. Check Cloudinary credentials in .env
   → CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME
   → CLOUDINARY_API_KEY
   → CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET
2. Check upload route exists
   → Frontend calls /api/upload
   → Backend has upload.js route
3. Check file size limit
   → May be restricted by Multer config
```

### Issue: "Logout button doesn't work"
```
Solution:
1. Check localStorage is accessible
   → Open DevTools → Application → localStorage
2. Check logout function exists
   → In AuthContext.tsx
3. Check token is being stored
   → localStorage.getItem('token') in console
4. Try clearing localStorage manually
   → DevTools → Application → localStorage → Clear All
```
